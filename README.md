## About

I had the idea for this project after reading [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/e3you/life_hack_the_3030_minute_work_cycle_feels_like/) article I found on reddit.
ItÂ´s my first ever python project - _I never touched python before_ - so the code might be unclean and messy (suggestions are welcome).
